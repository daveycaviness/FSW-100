        <h1>Lamborghini</h1>
        <h3>350 GT, Urraco, Espada, LM002, Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera, Diablo SE30 Jota, Aventador SVj, Huracan Performante, Countach.  </h3>
            <p> Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.
                
                The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.<cite>Wikipedia</cite> </p>

            <h3>356, 911 2.7 Carrera RS, 930 Turbo, 959, 911 GT1 Straßenversion, Carrera GT,  918 Spyder, Taycan.</h3>
                <p>Porsche has been successful in many branches of motorsport of which most have been in long distance races.

                    Despite their early involvement in motorsports being limited to supplying relatively small engines to racing underdogs up until the late 1960s, by the mid-1950s Porsche had already tasted moderate success in the realm of sports car racing, most notably in the Carrera Panamericana and Targa Florio, classic races which were later used in the naming of street cars. The Porsche 917 of 1969 turned them into a power house, winning in 1970 the first of over a dozen 24 Hours of Le Mans, more than any other company. With the 911 Carrera RS and the Porsche 935 Turbo, Porsche dominated the 1970s, and even has beaten sports prototypes, a category in which Porsche entered the successful 936, 956 and 962 models.
                    
                    Porsche is currently the world's largest race car manufacturer. In 2006, Porsche built 195 race cars for various international motor sports events, and in 2007 Porsche is expected to construct no less than 275 dedicated race cars (7 RS Spyder LMP2 prototypes, 37 GT2 spec 911 GT3-RSRs, and 231 911 GT3 Cup vehicles).
                    
                    Porsche regards racing as an essential part of ongoing engineering development—it was traditionally very rare for factory-entered Porsche racing cars to appear at consecutive races in the same specification. Some aspect of the car almost invariably, was being developed, whether for the future race programs or as proof of concept for future road cars.<cite>Wikipedia</cite> </p>

                    <p>Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren. Bruce was a works driver for the British Formula One team Cooper with whom he had won three Grands Prix and come second in the 1960 World Championship. Wanting to compete in the Australasian Tasman Series, Bruce approached his employers, but when team owner Charles Cooper insisted on using 1.5-litre Formula One-specification engines instead of the 2.5-litre motors permitted by the Tasman rules, Bruce decided to set up his own team to run him and his prospective Formula One teammate Timmy Mayer with custom-built Cooper cars.

                        Bruce won the 1964 series, but Mayer was killed in practice for the final race at the Longford Circuit in Tasmania. When Bruce McLaren approached Teddy Mayer to help him with the purchase of the Zerex sports car from Roger Penske, Teddy Mayer and Bruce McLaren began discussing a business partnership resulting in Teddy Mayer buying in to Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Limited (BMMR) ultimately becoming its largest shareholder. The team was based in Feltham in 1963–1964, and from 1965 until 1981 in Colnbrook, England. The team also held a British licence. Despite this, Bruce never used the traditional British racing green on his cars. Instead, he used colour schemes that were not based on national principles (e.g. his first car, the McLaren M2B, was painted white with a green stripe, to represent a fictional Yamura team in John Frankenheimer's film Grand Prix).<cite>Wikipedia</cite></p>

                        <p>It’s hard to think of a time when the Mercedes Benz wasn’t a topic of mainstream pop culture in Melbourne, Victoria, and all throughout Australia. It has been featured in countless songs, movies, television shows, and every other outlet in between for decades. But, where did the popular luxury car get started? 

                            First of all, it’s important to know that the Mercedes Benz was actually the first car ever built. You may immediately think of Ford as the first car manufacturer, but in reality, it was Karl Benz, a German co-founder of the company, who built the Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886. His eventual partner, Gottlieb Daimler produced the first gas-powered engine. In 1925, the two men came together to form the Daimler-Benz motor company and created the Mercedes vehicles that have become so popular, even today. 
                            
                            The Mercedes Benz has always been a fixture in luxury vehicles – or so most people think. It actually didn’t start out as such a high-class car. While the motto of Mercedes has always been ‘the best, or nothing,’ this is a company that started out small and didn’t become a world distributor of its luxury vehicles until later into the 20th century. However, that patience and attention to detail paid off. Today, Mercedes Benz are considered to be one of the safest, most reliable cars on the market. They also continue to be one of the most coveted and desired by car enthusiasts. 
                            
                            Without Daimler and Benz, we likely wouldn’t have much of the innovation on the road that we see today, and the manufacturing of luxury vehicles would undoubtedly be different. We have them to thank for modern vehicles, and the advancements in technology that continue to grow throughout the Mercedes line of cars. <cite>Wikipedia</cite></p>
